&lt;p>Earlier, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a student in Computer science at Ecole Polytechnique ⚔️ and I graduated in 2021 from University of Cambridge 👨‍🎓. See my &lt;a class="link" href="CV_AymericRoucher_03-22.pdf" >Curriculum Vitae&lt;/a> for greater detail.&lt;/p>

>Descartes&lt;/a> is a fast-growing french Insurtech, providing insurance against climate risks (cyclones, frost, wildfires&amp;hellip;) to a global set of clients.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Climate change would be better named Climate disruption: it causes a sharp increase in weather-related catastrophes. As a result, insured losses are growing, non-insured losses are exploding. We&amp;rsquo;re here to fill the coverage gap.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The company provides &lt;a class="link" href="https://corporatesolutions.swissre.com/insights/knowledge/what_is_parametric_insurance.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>parametric insurance&lt;/a>, a new kind of insurance in which the payment following an event is not subject an expert&amp;rsquo;s validation, but automatically triggered according to a predefined weather index. It could be for instance : &amp;ldquo;If a cyclone&amp;rsquo;s eye comes closer than 50km from your GPS coordinates, we pay.&amp;rdquo; This process ensures fast and hassle-free payments for the client, and easier risk calculation for the company - thus lower prices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The company is growing fast : when I joined in September 2021, we were only 30 FTEs, now we&amp;rsquo;re coming close to 100.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="my-job-there">My job there&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I joined the company to prototype and launch new products. Each product requires a vast set of competencies, and heavily relies on a data, from the sourcing of weather data from a third-party, to the risk calculations based on historical events and stochastic models.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means I constantly keep watching for new evolutions of the climate risks all over the globe, which is a worryisome, but truly captivating subject.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://a-roucher.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://a-roucher.github.io/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
